# calculator-project

Created This Repo 06/26/2023
This is the final project of The Odin Project's Foundation course!
This project consists of creating a working calculator from scratch, the scripts and the
UI. This project represents a summary of my experience so far with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

(It's important to note that the first commits will be an outline of the first attempt I made for the project. I had an emergency and had no internet for a while, but wanted to keep on coding! So if the first few commits seem too clean or out of order, it is because I already had gotten through a portion of this project initially.)
