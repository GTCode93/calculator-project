/* 
OBJECTIVES:
* What aesthetic/color scheme do I want the calculator to be? For now I'm leaning towards a green-ish theme cuz fun

* Borders and curves will make the design look good.
    * How will the calculator buttons look like? I want them to be square-ish and curved.
    * How will the main 2 flex items look like? I want the output to have a curve and grey-ish interior/background color with a black, curved border.
    * 1st flex item, output will also need the text to orient to the right. Cuz that's how calculators work or whatever
    * I don't imagine the 2nd flex item, the input, will have a border. To make it look cohesive to the main calculator, yk.

* What color will the font be?

* How will the calculator sit in the page? Should I sit it in the middle of the page or should I just leave it as a default in the top left?

* How large will the calculator be? That depends on general padding/margins of not just the calculator base but also the specific items.

* Flexbox issues will be written below here cuz that'll be majority of the work:
    *
