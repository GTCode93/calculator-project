OBJECTIVES:
* Not too much from here tbh lol
* What will the naming system be like?
    * Digits can be the number-button like "0-button"
    * The main flex items can be "output" and "input"
    * Operation buttons can be operation-button
    * Clear can be clear-button
    * Equal can be equal-button
* What aesthetic/color scheme do I want the calculator to be? For now I'm leaning towards a green-ish theme cuz fun
* Borders and curves will make the design look good.
    * How will the calculator buttons look like? I want them to be square-ish and curved.
    * How will the main 2 flex items look like? I want the output to have a curve and grey-ish interior/background color with a black, curved border.
    * 1st flex item, output will also need the text to orient to the right. Cuz that's how calculators work or whatever
    * I don't imagine the 2nd flex item, the input, will have a border. To make it look cohesive to the main calculator, yk.
* What font do I want the calculator to be? It's not super necessary, but why not go all out on the last project eh?
* What color will the font be?
* How will the calculator sit in the page? Should I sit it in the middle of the page or should I just leave it as a default in the top left?
* How large will the calculator be? That depends on general padding/margins of not just the calculator base but also the specific items.
* Flexbox issues will be written below here cuz that'll be majority of the work:
    *

OBJECTIVES FOR GETTING CALCULATOR TO WORK:
* Button event listeners galore. Figure out how to do that again when you can. Luckily i already set up the HTML buttons and classes, hopefully that can help you out!
